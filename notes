Clearly, the larger the array is, the more time it will take
to finish the function. Of the two functions (doublerAppend and doublerInsert,)
it seems as though doublerInsert scales worse than doublerAppend. As the arrays get
bigger, it obviously takes more time for each function, but the amount of time it takes
for doublerInsert is disproportianate to the amount of time it takes for doublerAppend
to complete, shown more clearly in the results for largeArray and extraLargeArray.
